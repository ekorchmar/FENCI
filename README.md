This is a working technical demo version of a game I'm still developing. Bugreports and suggestions are welcome.

This demo features:

– 8 weapon classes with innumerable randomly generated items

– 4 playable Arena-style levels with increasing enemy stats, aggression and loot quality

– Multiple playstyles supported by different equipment combinations

In the future releases you can expect:

– Armor and hats that enhance player stats

– Campaign featuring exploration of levels with complex geometry

– Unique bosses with special abilities

– Ranged weapons, like bows and magic wands
