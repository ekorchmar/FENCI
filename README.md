VERSION: 0.2

This is a working technical demo version of a game I'm still developing. Bugreports and suggestions are welcome.

This demo features:

- 9 weapon classes with innumerable randomly generated items

- 4 playable Arena-style levels with increasing enemy stats, aggression and loot quality

- Multiple playstyles supported by different equipment combinations

In the future releases you can expect:

- Armor and hats that enhance player stats

- Campaign featuring exploration of levels with complex geometry

- Unique bosses with special abilities

- Ranged weapons, including bows and magic wands

Known issues this release:
- Shield visually moves away if used while flipping character
- It is possible for small enemies to move close enough to arena border to be out of reach of shorter weapons
