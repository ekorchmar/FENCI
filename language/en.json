    "Pig iron is terrible smithing material, made from rejected ore. Orcs love it for it's weight and cheap price.",
    "Common belief is that faefolk is scared of iron weapons. In reality, anyone avoids enemy weapons regardless of material.",

    "It takes at least two powerful wizards to produce moonglow silver. It is extremely rare, because powerful wizards hate working together.",
    "Brewed dreamthorn leaves can induce deep comatose sleep. Similar effects are achieved by bashing enemy heads with dreamthorn weapons.",

    "Conservationists attempts to save unicorns from orcish braconiers led to existence of horses.",
    "Demon horns are not made of gold, despite what many demons themselves may claim.",
    "Moonbeasts are regarded as impossible to hunt. There is no need though, as they shed antlers each moon cycle.",

    "Breaking a wishbone spearhead makes you wish you had another weapon with you.",
    "Riverglass is collected from flooded ruins of ancient elven capital. They say that city was completely green.",
    "Ice from Niflheim newer thaws, which makes it essential for existence of Empire Capital's bars.",
    "Soulcrystals are produced by demons. Those who know, how exactly, never touch soulcrystal weapons.",
    "You can't make a weapon by bashing two diamonds with a stick. Not in this game.",
    "Dragonhide seems impossible to obtain, given there are no living dragons. And yet, rich traders still hold on to some stock.",

    "Demons are not related to any living things of this world, except possibly fairies.",
    "Elves avoidance of iron is cultural. Most elves will not touch any metal, with coins being unsurprising exception.",
    "Long time ago, the united Empire held off orcish invasion. Now orcs are natural citizens, and every aristocrat calls themselves a king.",
    "Orcs employ unique fighting style, that is impossible to copy. Only an orc can hold a sword by the wrong end and still club an enemy to death.",

    "Faeries, kobolds and even demons are known to hire orcish mercenaries.",
    "Fairy Godmother is powerful magic user and master politician, but she is not above sending her henchmen to beat her opposition senseless.",
    "Wizards are smart, secretive and power-hungry. No wonder they are drawn to politics.",
    "Empire church does not have a single center anymore, but distant monasteries still train monks in the old ways.",
    "Today's weather is expected to be nice, with small chance of impending apocalypse closer to the evening.",
    "Katars are banned the streets of Empire's Capital. So are most other weapons, but Order makes a big deal out of ban on Katars.",

  "tips": [
    "Heavy weapons deal more damage, but are slower to spin up and drain your stamina really fast.",
    "Raw damage output is important, but light and fast weapon may turn out to be a better choice.",
    "Stamina restores slower when it's low. Keep your cool.",
    "Even if you run out of stamina, you can still deal some damage by running into an enemy weapon forward.",
    "You are not guaranteed to get weapons you want or are used to. Your success depends on your ability to adapt.",
    "Keeping low durability weapons for their powerful stats will get you killed. You have to let go.",
    "Bleeding deals more damage to enemies with higher health pools.",
    "You can throw away weapons by holding mouse button over them while paused. Why would you want to do it?",
    "Hold Shift stops your weapons from moving and draining your stamina.",
    "Stamina restores much faster if you don't swing your weapons for some time.",
    "Light weapons are easier to control, but are also much easier to parry.",
    "Parrying enemy weapons hurts your stamina. You may want to dodge heavy hits instead.",
    "Weapon's SPEED shows how fast the weapon can change direction. It's easier to reach maximum damage of a fast weapon",
    "High SPEED weapons allow you to activate or charge their abilities faster and more often.",
    "Weapon's DRAIN shows how much stamina it costs to aim and use the weapon.",
    "Your weapon's damage is not random. The faster it moves, the harder it hits.",
    "Off-hand weapons do not consume stamina for aiming.",

    "Shield can't protect you from the back. Don't get surrounded.",
    "Initiating fight with a shield bash into a group of enemies is great way to scatter them.",
    "Heavier Shields deal more damage with bash and are more efficient at blocking damage.",
    "Lighter Shields have longer bash range and are faster to pick up.",
    "Shield damage potential is not to be underestimated. Enemies take additional damage from being thrown into a wall.",
    "Lighter shields have high DRAIN stat and convert more blocked damage in stamina loss.",

    "Swords are simple, deal a lot of damage and are a reliable tool in most situations.",
    "Long and heavy swords are very powerful, but require strict discipline with stamina management.",
    "Light short sword is a go-to weapon for most combat encounters.",
    "Swords don't offer much in terms of mobility. Pay attention to your positioning.",

    "Daggers have very short range and modest damage range, but offer best tactical options.",
    "Even accidental parry with a dagger will allow you to roll through your foes. Always look out for options!",
    "Daggers provide consistent damage at low stamina cost, even when swung.",

    "Spears are extremely powerful if you can keep your distance from your enemies.",
    "Even a powerful spear will perform poorly if you are swarmed by enemies. Keep a backup dagger.",
    "When skewering an enemy, best options are to stab them with your second weapon or to launch them into a wall.",
    "Holding activation button for spear will not increase your stab damage, but will allow you to target close enemies.",

    "Swordbreakers offer you same mobility as Daggers, so you may want to avoid this combination. If you hate having fun.",
    "Swordbreakers will briefly increase stamina restoration on any parry or hit, but it's still possible to run dry.",
    "If you are using a long spear, Swordbreaker can be a good sidearm to ward off close combat attackers.",

    "Falchion rolls do not require stamina, and allow you to restore it while rolling circles around the battlefield.",
    "Falchions have wild damage spread. Prepare your strikes carefully to stay efficient.",
    "Falchions lack Swords' reach and burst damage of stabbing attack. Be creative with your rolls to stay on top of enemies.",

    "Axe whirlwind is powerful, but requires a lot of preparation time and may leave you without stamina. Don't get caught.",
    "You don't always need whirlwind to fight multiple enemies with an Axe, it is effective even when simply swung.",
    "Axes are scary close combat weapons, but offer neither reach nor mobility. Make sure to make up for it with your loadout.",
    "With good Axe, you can kill a goblin by just one hit. Be careful to not waste all stamina trying to get lucky.",

    "Katars deal little damage up front, but provide good utility in bleeding and controling enemies.",
    "Heavy Katars cause heavier bleeding, but light ones allow you to hold enemies for much longer.",
    "Katar stab costs very little stamina and restores stamina on each successful hit. Keep up the aggression.",
    "Use your main weapons on enemies you hold with Katar for maximum damage. Warning: might be considered a war crime."
